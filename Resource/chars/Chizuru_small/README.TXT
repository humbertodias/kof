  FINAL NOTES AND TIPS:
 =======================

         Some tips you should remember when USING chizuru kagura:

         1. All her basic moves are good at pushing enemies away...

         2. Most of her special moves require a certain distance, so keep your enemies

            away and you'll win very easily..

         3. Chizuru has a very nasty reach!

         4. She is not that much of a combo girl but there are combo's for you to find out..

         5. Oh.. yes... don't forget to keep using your Super moves ^_^

         6. Warning, her illusions can be hurt, and thus hurting you.... It will absolutely

            hurt when an opponent hits both you and your illusion (you get twice the damage ^_^).
