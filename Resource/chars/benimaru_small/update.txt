Benimaru Nikaido 100% updated.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** MUGEN VERSION SELECTION ***

 Benimaru is compatible with all currently available Mugen versions from 04.14.2001 and up.
 But in order for Benimaru to work properly in the Mugen version of your choice, you must
 select the proper code files for him to use.  To do so, open up his .def file in a text
 editor, and find these lines:

;st3     = 2001-04.txt    ;States for Mugen 04.14.2001
st3      = 2002.txt       ;States for Mugen 11.01.2001+

 By default, he's configured to be used with Mugen 11.01.2001 and up.  If you're using
 Mugen 04.14.2001, add a semicolon before the second st3 line, and remove the semicolon
 from the beginning of the first st3 line.
 Furthermore, if you're using Mugen 04.14.2001, but have corrected the guard recovery time
 bug in States 151 & 153 in your copy of /data/common1.cns, then open 2001-04.txt and
 follow the instruction found at [State 5900, MugenVersion].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM ***

 Benimaru has a 3 level AI. All you have to do is edit benimaru.def using notepad.

 cmd     = benimaru.cmd      ;Hard-AI
 ;cmd      = benimedai.cmd   ;Medium-AI
 ;cmd     = beninoai.cmd     ;No-AI

 Just remove the semicolon AT THE START OF THE LINE before the AI level of your choice and
 make sure the unwanted levels have semicolon before them. In the example above, it is
 setup to use low level AI.
